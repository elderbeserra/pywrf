Well, we (a bunch of people at Monash University, Melbourne, Australia) use WRF for numerical weather prediction. More specifically WRF is being used to study cloud seeding, tropical cloud regimes, and interaction of bushfires and meteorology.

We like python and wrote a few functions to use python together with matplotlib (and its basemap toolkit) to post-process WRF output and generate pretty pictures that will (hopefully) help us make sense of the simulations.

This project has been created to
  * provide a central (sub-versioned) repository for our library of functions
  * force us to tidy up our codes ;)
  * prevent duplication of similar efforts, and maybe facilitate the use of Python together with WRF for others...
